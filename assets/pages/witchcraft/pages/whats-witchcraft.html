      <h2 class="title">What's Witchcraft?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">It may seem strange, but witchcraft isn’t exactly like that have shown in movies and animations, which makes potions with frog’s leg and spiders’ eyes. Going to the real world, it’s the act of putting your intention into practice and manipulate reality. For such, it’s very common witches enjoy herbs, crystals, candles, incenses and magic tools, but none of those are necessary to practice witchcraft, because the magic is into you, the fruit from nature.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Witchcraft has been with us since humanity’s beginnings. An example of that, is people from the paleolithic (polished stone age), with the purpose of getting food the next day, they draw above rocks animals (their meal). Yes, I’m referring to rupestrian art. And there is more: have you ever listening to Willendorf Venus? It’s a statuette that was sculpted between 28.000 and 25.000 years before Christ, according to current studies, it was a big symbol for past peoples. But, what does that have to do with witchcraft? Well, the woman's body was extremely important during cults, rituals and charms to nature. 
        <br>The magick have continued during the Old Age, Medium, Modern and Contemporary, but this will stay to another article.

      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Ok, now I known witchcraft's meaning and how it emerged, but how I start practice? Well, I advise you to study a lot in the first months, yes only theory. The theory is the basis of something that you want to do, so, when you be ready, it’s time to make it! Another thing very interesting is to create your witchcraft itself - I know, know, it’s like veeery complicated, don’t worry, you can do it!
        <br>Then, search in different books and articles, don’t be locked in only one author or content, because, in the same form that nature, witchcraft just exists because there are many ways and things to do and learn.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph attention">Pay attention! All content is based on my studies and particular positioning (of a beginner witch), so you must not be locked only it; search in different websites and books, make your own path.</p>
